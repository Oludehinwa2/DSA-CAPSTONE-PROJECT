# Amazon Product Review Analysis – Excel Dashboard Project

# Overview:

This project involved analyzing Amazon product listings and customer reviews using Excel to extract actionable insights for e-commerce business decisions. As part of a data analytics capstone, I built a comprehensive, interactive Excel dashboard to help sellers identify key product performance metrics, customer engagement trends, and revenue optimization strategies.
Key Objectives:
	•	Analyze over 1,400 Amazon products with 16 columns of data including ratings, discounts, price, and review count.
	•	Create insightful visualizations using PivotTables, slicers, and various Excel chart types.
	•	Enable interactive filtering and drill-down analysis across product categories, rating distributions, pricing buckets, and more.

## 💡 Business Insights (Summary)

High Discount ≠ High Rating: Many discounted items still received poor ratings. Price cuts alone won’t ensure customer satisfaction.

Most Reviewed Category: Electronics had the most reviews but also a wide range in satisfaction.

Revenue Optimization: Focus marketing efforts on mid-priced, highly rated products in "Home Kitchen" and "Accessories".

Product Opportunity: Products with moderate ratings but high volume reviews may benefit from improved quality or targeted feedback campaigns.

Outlier Products: A few products drive massive engagement. Promoting these further can help with cross-selling.
